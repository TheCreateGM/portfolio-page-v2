    "content": "# Building a Full-Stack Portfolio\n\nIn this post, I'll walk you through how I built this portfolio website from scratch.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n### Frontend\n- **React** with TypeScript for type safety\n- **Vite** for lightning-fast development\n- **Tailwind CSS** for beautiful, responsive design\n\n### Backend Services\n- **Supabase** for authentication and database\n- **Giscus** for GitHub-based comments\n- **Vercel** for deployment and hosting\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile and desktop\n2. **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching\n3. **Blog System**: You're reading it!\n4. **Project Showcase**: Dynamic project cards\n5. **Contact Form**: Easy way to get in touch\n\n## Development Process\n\nI started with a simple static site and gradually added features. The key was to:\n\n- Plan the architecture first\n- Build incrementally\n- Test thoroughly\n- Deploy early and often\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n- **TypeScript is worth it**: Caught so many bugs early\n- **Tailwind speeds up development**: No more wrestling with CSS\n- **Vercel is amazing**: Deploy with a single `git push`\n\nCheck out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheCreateGM/portfolio-page-v2)!",

    "content": "# My Journey with TypeScript\n\n## Why I Switched from JavaScript\n\nI used to write pure JavaScript. Then I discovered TypeScript, and everything changed.\n\n## The Benefits\n\n### 1. Catch Bugs Early\n```typescript\n// TypeScript catches this before runtime!\nfunction greet(name: string) {\n  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);\n}\n\ngreet(123); // Error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'\n```\n\n### 2. Better IntelliSense\n\nYour editor becomes 10x smarter with TypeScript. Auto-completion, inline documentation, and instant error checking.\n\n### 3. Refactoring Confidence\n\nRename a function? TypeScript updates all references. No more \"find and replace\" disasters.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you're new to TypeScript:\n\n1. Start with `any` types (it's okay!)\n2. Gradually add proper types\n3. Enable strict mode when comfortable\n4. Use type inference - let TS do the work\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n- **Don't over-type everything**: Sometimes `any` is fine\n- **Use interfaces for objects**: More flexible than types\n- **Enable strict mode gradually**: Don't overwhelm yourself\n\n## My Recommendation\n\nIf you're starting a new project, use TypeScript. If you have an existing project, migrate gradually. The initial learning curve is worth it!\n\nHappy coding! 🚀",
